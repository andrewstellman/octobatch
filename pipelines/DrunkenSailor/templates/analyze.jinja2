A drunken sailor left a bar and stumbled randomly toward either the ship (position 10, safety) or the water (position 0, falls in).

Starting position: {{ start_position }}
Final position: {{ position }}
Steps taken: {{ steps_taken }}
Path taken: {{ path }}

Analyze the sailor's random walk and determine the outcome.

Respond with a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "scenario_name": "{{ scenario_name }}",
  "final_position": <final position as integer>,
  "steps_taken": <number of steps as integer>,
  "path": [<array of integer positions visited>],
  "outcome": "fell_in_water" or "reached_ship"
}

Rules:
- If final position is 0, outcome is "fell_in_water"
- If final position is 10, outcome is "reached_ship"
- path should be the full array of positions from the walk
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.
