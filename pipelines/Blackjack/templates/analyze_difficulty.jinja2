## Task

Rate the overall difficulty of the decisions in this hand as easy, medium, or hard.

Consider:
- Was the correct play obvious or ambiguous?
- Did the hand involve close calls or borderline situations?
- Would different strategies have made very different choices here?
- Were there multiple decision points?

Respond with a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "strategy_name": "{{ strategy_name }}",
  "result": "{{ result }}",
  "accuracy": {{ accuracy }},
  "difficulty": "easy" or "medium" or "hard",
  "difficult_moments": ["moment 1", "moment 2"],
  "explanation": "Why this hand was easy/medium/hard to play"
}

Rules:
- difficulty must be exactly one of: easy, medium, hard
- difficult_moments should list specific decision points that were challenging (empty array [] if easy)
- strategy_name must be exactly "{{ strategy_name }}"
- result must be exactly "{{ result }}"
- accuracy must be exactly {{ accuracy }}
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.
