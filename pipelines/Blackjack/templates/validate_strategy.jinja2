## Strategy-Specific Checks

Apply the checks for the specific strategy used:

**The Pro** (basic strategy):
- Did they hit on hard 16 against dealer 7 or higher?
- Did they stand on 17+?
- Did they double down on 11?
- Did they split aces and eights (if applicable)?

**The Gambler** (aggressive):
- Did they always hit on 16 regardless of dealer card?
- Did they double down on any 10 or 11?
- Did they take aggressive risks even with bad odds?

**The Coward** (conservative):
- Did they stand on any 12 or higher?
- Did they never double down?
- Did they never split?

Score the accuracy of strategy adherence from 0.0 to 1.0.

Respond with a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "strategy_name": "{{ strategy_name }}",
  "accuracy": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "deviations": ["deviation 1 description", "deviation 2 description"],
  "assessment": "Overall assessment of strategy adherence"
}

Rules:
- accuracy of 1.0 means the strategy was followed perfectly
- accuracy of 0.0 means the strategy was completely ignored
- deviations should list specific moments where the strategy was not followed (empty array [] if perfect)
- Be rigorous — check each decision against the strategy rules
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.
